Batmobile
=========

Batmobile is a sample project that implements ride requests using the `Intents` framework (aka SiriKit). Rides can be requested* using both Siri, and within the Maps app.

*Rides are never actually requested, though it would be trivial to plug in the Lyft or Uber API.

## Usage

1. Build & run the app on your device. Confirm when prompted w/ the Siri permissions dialog.
2. Once you have authorized the app to use Siri, there are two ways to request a ride:
	* Ask Siri "Request a ride using Batmobile"
	* Open the Maps app, get directions to a location, and select the **Rides** tab
